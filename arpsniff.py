RFC 5227, IPv4 Address Conflict Detection, July 2008, page 4-5

In this document, the term 'ARP Probe' is used to refer to an ARP
Request packet, broadcast on the local link, with an all-zero 'sender
IP address'.  The 'sender hardware address' MUST contain the hardware
address of the interface sending the packet.  The 'sender IP address'
field MUST be set to all zeroes, to avoid polluting ARP caches in
other hosts on the same link in the case where the address turns out
to be already in use by another host.  The 'target hardware address'
field is ignored and SHOULD be set to all zeroes.  The 'target IP
address' field MUST be set to the address being probed.  An ARP Probe
conveys both a question ("Is anyone using this address?") and an
implied statement ("This is the address I hope to use.").
